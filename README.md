* **Step 4:** Change the date to today's date and change "Someone" to your name. Change the date to the date you're doing this task. The format is up to you. 
* **Step 5:** Change the text in this block to anything you want. Tell about yourself, where do you live, your hobbies, your favorite foods and drinks, why do you take Makers Institute .NET Academy, your status, etc. Be Creative!

After you finish editing, save the file.
